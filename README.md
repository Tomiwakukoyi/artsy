This project, Artsy is being built with React JS

The project is a multipage website made with React and its best practices

- I made use of SASS for the styling of the website instead of my well used Tailwind CSS or styled commponents
- I also made use of some React best practices like Hooks and React router for linking the pages.
- I use Icons from Icon scout library on this project for the few icons i needed.
- I also ensured i used the full power of react and components by breaaking things down to the minimum while
ensuring proper folder structure.

NB : only available on large screens for now.
